to make this program actually act like shell with not editing the execute file is to: 
  std file discriptor->stdin(3) â€” Linux manual page -> https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/stdout.3.html
  
  
  to search for '(', ')', '&' for exec command see strTok(), more effective 
  
  add more command and functionality:
    clear
    pipe 
    redirect
